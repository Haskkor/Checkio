##Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
##
##But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

##A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
##
##Input: A game result as a list of strings (unicode).
##
##Output: "X", "O" or "D" as a string.
##
##Example:
##
##checkio([
##    "X.O",
##    "XX.",
##    "XOO"]) == "X"
##checkio([
##    "OO.",
##    "XOX",
##    "XOX"]) == "O"
##checkio([
##    "OOX",
##    "XXO",
##    "OXX"]) == "D"
##
##How it is used: The concepts in this task will help you when iterating data types. They can also be used in game algorithms, allowing you to know how to check results.
